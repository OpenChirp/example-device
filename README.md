# Example OpenChirp Device
This is a minimal program that serves as an OpenChirp device.
A program like this is used as the underlying target of a single OpenChirp
device.
As an example, this device represents a physical door. You can request to
open it and independently it reports it's open/closed status.

This example uses the [OpenChirp Golang framework library](https://github.com/OpenChirp/framework).

Please see [main.go](main.go) to understand more about how services operate.
